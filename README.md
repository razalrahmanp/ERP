In this updated code, two new methods are added to the  Restaurant  class:  SaveMenuToDatabase  and  LoadMenuFromDatabase . The  SaveMenuToDatabase  method uses SQL queries to clear the existing menu items table and insert the current menu items into the database. The  LoadMenuFromDatabase  method retrieves menu items from the database and populates the  Menu  list. 
 
Please make sure to replace "YourConnectionString" with the actual connection string for your SQL Server database.
